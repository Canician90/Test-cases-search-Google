My name is Petru Marius Canician and I want to work in IT as a junior tester. I am a passionate and dedicated person who wants to use my technical skills to contribute to developing and improving IT products and services. 
I believe that I can face challenges and find creative solutions to technical problems, having the ability to quickly adapt to technology changes and easily learn new technologies and software development tools. 
Also, I can easily integrate into the team, being communicative and sociable, with excellent communication and collaboration skills.
